This document summarizes peer-reviewed studies that explore the use of **tympanometry** for assessing **middle ear function**, **equalisation ability**, and **barotrauma risk** in diving contexts.

## 1. Assessment of Middle Ear Function in Recreational Divers

- **Title**: *The Impact of Regular Diving on the Condition of the Middle Ear*
- **Authors**: Wawrzyniec Loba et al.
- **Journal**: *International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health* (2021)
- **Summary**:  
  Evaluated 31 recreational divers using classic and wideband tympanometry. Despite 38.7% reporting periodic pressure equalisation issues, tympanometry showed normal middle ear function overall.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ❌ No

## 2. Predicting Middle Ear Barotrauma Using Tympanometry

- **Title**: *Eustachian Tube Function Test as a Predictor of Middle Ear Barotrauma*
- **Authors**: Konstantin Georgiev, Nikola Shopov
- **Journal**: *International Maritime Health* (2020)
- **Summary**:  
  Involved 35 professional divers. Tympanometry was performed before and after hyperbaric chamber exposure, along with Valsalva maneuvers.  
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **How It Was Done**:  
  - Divers performed Valsalva before pressurisation.
  - Tympanometric values were measured; if pressure change exceeded 20 daPa, ET was considered patent (open).  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Divers with tympanometric shifts >20 daPa during Valsalva were **able to equalise successfully** in the hyperbaric chamber.  
  - Suggested tympanometry as a **predictive tool for equalisation success**.

## 3. Tympanometry in Pressure Chamber Assessments

- **Title**: *Pressure Chamber Tympanometry in Diving Candidates*
- **Authors**: A. Shupak et al.
- **Journal**: *Annals of Otology, Rhinology & Laryngology* (1991)
- **Summary**:  
  Studied 42 naval diving candidates. Tympanometry was done at 1 and 1.1 ATA inside a pressure chamber in seated and supine positions.  
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **How It Was Done**:  
  - Tympanometric pressure shifts were measured in response to pressurisation.  
  - Assessed if candidates could equalise naturally as pressure increased.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Identified individuals who could not equalise effectively despite no obvious otologic issues at rest.  
  - Showed **importance of dynamic testing** under pressure conditions to assess equalisation ability.

## 4. Monitoring Middle Ear Barotrauma in Recreational Divers

- **Title**: *Incidence and Severity of Middle Ear Barotrauma in Recreational Scuba Divers*
- **Authors**: J.A. Edmonds et al.
- **Journal**: *Journal of Travel Medicine* (1997)
- **Summary**:  
  11 experienced divers underwent tympanometry daily for 15 days of diving.  
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ❌ No (focus was post-dive status)
- **Key Findings**:  
  - 32% of ears showed abnormal tympanometry at some point.  
  - Most recovered spontaneously even with continued diving.

## 5. Measuring Dynamic Eustachian Tube Function in a Pressure Chamber

- **Title**: *Measuring Dynamic Eustachian Tube Function Using Tympanometry in a Pressure Chamber*
- **Authors**: C.R. Anderson et al.
- **Journal**: *The Journal of Laryngology & Otology* (2019)
- **Summary**:  
  Investigated effect of nasal betahistine on ET opening using tympanometry in a pressure chamber.  
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **How It Was Done**:  
  - Tympanometry was performed while subjects underwent pressure changes and attempted to equalise via swallowing or Valsalva.  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - No significant effect of betahistine was found.  
  - But tympanometry effectively captured **middle ear pressure changes** due to active equalisation efforts under pressure.

## 6. Tympanometric Evaluation of Middle Ear Barotrauma During Recreational Scuba Diving

- **Title**: *Tympanometric Evaluation of Middle Ear Barotrauma During Recreational Scuba Diving*
- **Authors**: S.M. Green, S.G. Rothrock, E.A. Green
- **Journal**: *International Journal of Sports Medicine* (1993)
- **Summary**:  
  Two divers were monitored with tympanometry and otoscopy over several repetitive dives.  
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ⚠️ Indirectly  
- **Key Findings**:  
  - Middle ear pressure dropped with dive frequency, suggesting ET stress.  
  - Tympanometry was useful for detecting middle ear bleeding and potential rupture, but no active testing of equalisation techniques was performed.

## Summary Table: Equalisation in Tympanometry Studies

| Study Title | Equalisation Assessed | Method | Finding |
|-------------|------------------------|--------|---------|
| ET Function Test as Predictor | ✅ Yes | Tympanometry + Valsalva | >20 daPa shift → successful equalisation |
| ET Function in Pressure Chamber | ✅ Yes | Tympanometry + maneuvers under pressure | ET opening observed via pressure shifts |
