## üõ†Ô∏è Notes for DIY System

If you're planning to replicate or build a research prototype:
- **Use nasal olive for sealed sound delivery**
- **Pick 7‚Äì9.5‚ÄØkHz tone** for better tube transmission
- **Use MEMS mic or Etymotic ER-7C** for canal recording
- **Process signals with FFT/STFT** for ET opening detection
