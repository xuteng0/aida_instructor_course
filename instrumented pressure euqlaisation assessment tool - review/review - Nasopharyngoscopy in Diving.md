# Nasopharyngoscopy in Diving: Applications and Insights

**Nasopharyngoscopy** is an endoscopic procedure that enables direct visualization of the nasopharynx and the pharyngeal orifice of the **Eustachian tube (ET)**. It is used to evaluate whether the ET opens properly during equalisation maneuvers such as swallowing or Valsalva — a critical function for divers to prevent barotrauma.

## 1. Comparative Study of Eustachian Tube Functions in Normal and Diseased Ears

- **Title**: *A Comparative Study of Eustachian Tube Functions in Normal and Diseased Ears with Tympanometry and Videonasopharyngoscopy*
- **Author**: Komal Chauhan
- **Journal**: *Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery* (2013)
- **Summary**:  
  Compared ET function in healthy and diseased ears using tympanometry and videonasopharyngoscopy.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:
  - Nasopharyngoscopy directly visualized ET opening during swallowing.
  - Detected dysfunction not always picked up by tympanometry.
- **Relevance to Diving**: Useful for identifying equalisation issues that may lead to middle ear barotrauma.

## 2. Comparison of Video Nasopharyngoscopy and Tympanometry in Suspected Eustachian Tube Dysfunction

- **Title**: *Comparison of Video Nasopharyngoscopy and Tympanometry in Suspected Eustachian Tube Dysfunction – A Prospective Study*
- **Authors**: Bini Faizal, Binshy Latheef, Niveditha Kartha
- **Journal**: *Indian Journal of Otolaryngology and Head & Neck Surgery* (2024)
- **Summary**:  
  Investigated whether video nasopharyngoscopy could more accurately identify ET dysfunction in patients compared to tympanometry.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:
  - Nasopharyngoscopy was **more sensitive** in detecting dysfunction.
  - Combining both tests gave a more complete clinical picture.
- **Relevance to Diving**: Could improve screening and reduce risk of dive-related ear injuries.

## 3. Eustachian Tube Function x Nasopharyngoscopy: A Comparative Study

- **Title**: *Eustachian Tube Function x Nasopharyngoscopy: A Comparative Study Among the Evaluation Procedures of the Eustachian Tube*
- **Authors**: Isabella M. C. Silva, Mariza R. Feniman, José C. Jorge
- **Journal**: *Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology* (2001)
- **Summary**:  
  Used nasopharyngoscopy to assess ET opening in people with tympanic membrane perforations.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:
  - ET opening and closure could be directly observed during maneuvers.
  - Gave functional and structural insights into equalisation ability.
- **Relevance to Diving**: Helps determine suitability for diving in patients with prior ear conditions.

## Applications in Diving

Although nasopharyngoscopy is not typically performed underwater, it offers important benefits in dive medicine:

- ✅ **Pre-dive screening**: Identifies ET dysfunctions that impair equalisation.
- ✅ **Post-dive diagnostics**: Investigates causes of barotrauma after symptoms appear.
- ✅ **Education/training**: Helps divers understand how their ET opens during maneuvers.

## Summary Table

| Study Title | Year | Equalisation Assessed? | Key Findings |
|-------------|------|------------------------|--------------|
| Comparative Study of ET Functions | 2013 | ✅ Yes | Directly visualized ET opening; identified dysfunctions not seen on tympanometry. |
| Nasopharyngoscopy vs Tympanometry | 2024 | ✅ Yes | Nasopharyngoscopy more sensitive than tympanometry in detecting dysfunction. |
| ET Function x Nasopharyngoscopy | 2001 | ✅ Yes | Effective tool for assessing ET behavior in patients with ear conditions. |

## Conclusion

**Nasopharyngoscopy** offers a direct method to observe ET opening during equalisation attempts. While not a substitute for functional tests like sonotubometry or tubomanometry, it provides **visual confirmation of structural or functional obstructions**, making it highly useful in diver screening and ENT clinical diagnostics related to diving fitness.
