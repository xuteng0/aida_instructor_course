# Tubomanometry in Diving: Key Studies and Applications

This document reviews research involving the application of **tubomanometry** (TMM) in diving and pressure-related otologic assessments, focusing on **Eustachian tube (ET) function** and **middle ear equalisation**.

## 1. Dysbaric Otorhinolaryngology in Diving: Characteristics and Contributing Factors

* **Type**: Doctoral Dissertation
* **Institution**: University of Helsinki
* **Year**: 2024
* **Summary**:
  Investigated various dysbaric conditions affecting ears and sinuses in divers. Evaluated **tubomanometry** as a tool for objectively examining ET function in divers with suspected middle ear equalisation difficulties.
* **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes
* **Findings**:

  * TMM identified functional ET issues in divers.
  * Highlighted both diagnostic potential and practical challenges of TMM in dive medicine.

## 2. Medium-Term Assessment of Eustachian Tube Function After Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty

* **Journal**: *Auris Nasus Larynx*
* **Year**: 2017
* **Summary**:
  TMM was used to assess ET function after **Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET)**. Included baro-challenged individuals, relevant to diving.
* **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes
* **Findings**:

  * 80% showed improved TMM results.
  * 33% achieved normal tubomanometric curves post-BET.

## 3. Investigation of Eustachian Tube Dysfunction by Tubomanometry in Chronic Otitis Media Patients

* **Institution**: Eskişehir Osmangazi University
* **Year**: 2023
* **Summary**:
  Evaluated TMM for diagnosing ET dysfunction in chronic ear conditions. Though not diving-specific, mechanisms apply.
* **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes
* **Findings**:

  * TMM offered a non-invasive assessment of ET patency.
  * Supported use in surgical planning and barotrauma risk reduction.

## 4. Diagnostic Accuracy of Tubomanometry R Value in Detecting the Eustachian Tube Pressure Equalizing Function

* **Journal**: *European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology*
* **Year**: 2017
* **Summary**:
  This study focused on validating the **R value** (a TMM-derived metric) for detecting ET pressure equalisation function. Although not diving-specific, it strengthens the methodological reliability of TMM in baro-related assessments.
* **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes
* **Findings**:

  * R value showed significant correlation with ET function.
  * Demonstrated strong diagnostic accuracy for identifying dysfunction.
