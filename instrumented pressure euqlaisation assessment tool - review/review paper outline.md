Certainly! Here's an outline for a review paper titled:

## **Title**

**Instrumented Methods for Assessing Eustachian Tube Function and Ear Equalisation in Divers: A Comparative Review**

---

## **Abstract**

A concise summary of the rationale, methods compared, key findings, and recommendations for use in diving training, screening, and clinical evaluation.

---

## **1. Introduction**

* Background on **barotrauma**, **middle ear injuries**, and **equalisation failure** in diving and freediving.
* Importance of **assessing Eustachian tube (ET) function** before diving.
* Current challenges: No universal screening method; lack of real-time, non-invasive tools.
* Objective: Compare existing instrumented methods for assessing ear equalisation success based on usability in **diving instruction**, **clinical screening**, and **research**.

---

## **2. Physiology of Equalisation in Diving**

* Basic anatomy of the Eustachian tube and middle ear.
* Mechanisms of equalisation (Valsalva, Toynbee, Frenzel).
* Failure to equalise: risks and typical symptoms.
* Use cases: when divers, instructors, or clinicians might assess ET function.

## **3. Methods for Assessing ET Function and Equalisation**

Each subsection includes:

* Short principle of operation
* Common protocols
* Accuracy and limitations

### 3.1 Tympanometry

### 3.2 Sonotubometry

### 3.3 Tubomanometry

### 3.4 Manometry (Middle Ear Pressure Tracking)

### 3.5 Nasopharyngoscopy (Visual ET Opening)

### 3.6 Video Otoscopy (Tympanic Membrane Inspection)

### 3.7 Imaging (MRI / CT) â€” Anatomical context only

---

## **4. Comparison Framework**

Define criteria used to compare methods:

* **Accuracy of detecting equalisation**
* **Real-time vs. static**
* **Objectivity vs. subjectivity**
* **Ease of use in field/training**
* **Invasiveness**
* **Cost and availability**
* **Educational value (demonstration)**

---

## **5. Comparative Analysis**

### 5.1 Method-by-method comparison table

### 5.2 Contextual use-case recommendations

* Best for **diving schools / training**
* Best for **clinical ENT screening**
* Best for **barotrauma research**

---

## **6. Discussion**

* What methods are most viable in diving instruction today?
* Which technologies have potential for future adoption (e.g. portable sonotubometry)?
* Limitations of current tools and studies
* Importance of diver education in self-assessment and awareness

---

## **7. Conclusion**

* Summary of key findings
* Recommendations for different user groups (instructors, clinicians, researchers)
* Call for further research, especially for field-deployable tools

---

## **8. References**

* ENT, diving medicine, and otology literature supporting each method.
* Papers that validated these tools in underwater or pressure-chamber contexts.
