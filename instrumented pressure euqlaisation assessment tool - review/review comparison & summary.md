# Comparison of Ear Equalisation Assessment Methods for Diving Courses

This document reviews and compares various methods used to assess **ear equalisation success**, focusing on their **suitability for diving courses**. Each method is described briefly, followed by a structured comparison based on practicality, objectivity, and educational value.

## 1. Tympanometry

### 🔍 How It Works
Tympanometry measures **eardrum compliance** by varying pressure in the ear canal and detecting how much the tympanic membrane moves. It helps determine middle ear pressure and ET function — before or after equalisation.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: Objective, quick, and non-invasive.
- **Cons**: Cannot confirm equalisation in real-time; requires clinical equipment.

---

## 2. Sonotubometry

### 🔍 How It Works
A tone is played through the nose. If the ET opens during a swallow or Valsalva, the sound is transmitted and detected in the external ear canal. This provides real-time feedback of ET opening.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: Real-time, objective, demonstrable.
- **Cons**: Requires basic hardware and setup, but suitable for workshops.

## 3. Tubomanometry

### 🔍 How It Works
A short pressure pulse is introduced into the nasopharynx while the subject swallows. If the ET opens, the pressure reaches the middle ear and is detected in the ear canal.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: Quantifies ET opening efficiency.
- **Cons**: Requires dedicated equipment and some training to use.

---

## 4. Manometry

### 🔍 How It Works
Measures **real-time middle ear pressure** changes during equalisation attempts, often in a pressure chamber. It’s the gold standard in research for tracking equalisation dynamics.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: Highly accurate.
- **Cons**: Impractical — expensive, invasive, research-only.

---

## 5. Nasopharyngoscopy

### 🔍 How It Works
An endoscope is inserted through the nose to visually inspect the ET orifice while the subject swallows or performs Valsalva. Direct visualization of ET opening is possible.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: Clear anatomical demonstration.
- **Cons**: Invasive, uncomfortable, and unsuitable for routine training.

---

## 6. Video Otoscopy

### 🔍 How It Works
A digital otoscope is used to inspect the tympanic membrane before and after equalisation. While it doesn’t detect ET opening directly, changes (e.g., bulging, retraction) may indicate pressure changes.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: Highly visual and educational; great for teaching ear anatomy and barotrauma signs.
- **Cons**: Cannot confirm ET opening directly.

---

## 7. MRI / CT Imaging

### 🔍 How It Works
Provides anatomical views of the ET and surrounding structures. MRI can detect soft tissue inflammation; CT maps ET pathways.

### 🎯 Use in Diving Course
- **Pros**: High-resolution anatomical detail.
- **Cons**: Not real-time, expensive, and not educationally practical.

## 🏁 Recommendation

For diving instructors or course designers seeking tools to **teach** and **screen** for ear equalisation ability:

### ✅ Best Overall (Training + Screening)
- **Sonotubometry**: Real-time, demonstrable, reasonably accessible.
- **Video Otoscopy**: Ideal for anatomical and barotrauma education.

### ⚠️ Useful with Constraints
- **Tympanometry / Tubomanometry**: Clinical screening, not dynamic.
- **Nasopharyngoscopy**: Good for ENT lectures, not for beginner courses.

### ❌ Not Recommended for Course Use
- **Manometry**: Research-only.
- **MRI/CT**: Structural insight but impractical and costly.
