# Tubomanometry in Diving: Key Studies and Applications

This document reviews research involving the application of **tubomanometry** (TMM) in diving and pressure-related otologic assessments, focusing on **Eustachian tube function** and **middle ear equalisation**.

## 1. Dysbaric Otorhinolaryngology in Diving: Characteristics and Contributing Factors

- **Type**: Doctoral Dissertation
- **Institution**: University of Helsinki
- **Year**: 2024
- **Summary**:  
  This dissertation investigates various dysbaric conditions affecting the ears and sinuses in divers. It evaluates **tubomanometry** as a tool for objectively examining **Eustachian tube function** in divers with suspected middle ear equalisation difficulties.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:  
  - Tubomanometry was useful for identifying functional ET issues in divers.
  - Highlighted both the **diagnostic potential** and **practical challenges** of using TMM in dive medicine.

## 2. Medium-Term Assessment of Eustachian Tube Function After Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty

- **Journal**: *Auris Nasus Larynx*
- **Year**: 2017
- **Summary**:  
  This study used tubomanometry to assess **Eustachian tube function** in patients who underwent **Balloon Eustachian Tuboplasty (BET)**. While not exclusively about divers, it included individuals with **baro-challenged Eustachian tubes**, relevant to diving physiology.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:  
  - 80% of patients showed improvement in TMM results.
  - 33% achieved normal tubomanometric curves post-treatment.

## 3. Investigation of Eustachian Tube Dysfunction by Tubomanometry in Chronic Otitis Media Patients

- **Institution**: Eskişehir Osmangazi University
- **Year**: 2023
- **Summary**:  
  This clinical study evaluated the use of **tubomanometry** for diagnosing **ET dysfunction** in patients with chronic ear issues. Though primarily for otitis media, the findings are applicable to divers due to shared mechanisms of pressure equalisation.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:  
  - TMM provided a non-invasive way to assess Eustachian tube patency.
  - Supported its integration into **surgical planning** and **barotrauma prevention** strategies.
