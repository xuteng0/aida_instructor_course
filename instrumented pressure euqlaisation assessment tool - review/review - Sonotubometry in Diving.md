## 1. Altered Eustachian Tube Function in SCUBA Divers With Alternobaric Vertigo

- **Journal**: *Otology & Neurotology*
- **Year**: 2014
- **Summary**:  
  Compared 44 SCUBA divers who had experienced middle ear-related diving incidents with 20 healthy divers. Eustachian tube function was evaluated using **sonotubometry** and impedance tests.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:  
  - Significant differences in sonotubometric parameters (duration, amplitude, and air volume) between injured and healthy divers.
  - Recommended sonotubometry as a **preventive tool** for identifying equalisation issues in divers.

## 2. Pilot Study Evaluating Surfactant on Eustachian Tube Function in Divers

- **Journal**: *Military Medicine*
- **Year**: 2008
- **Summary**:  
  This pilot study examined whether nasal surfactant could improve ET function in divers. ET function was assessed pre- and post-dive using **sonotubometry** and tympanometric methods.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:  
  - Surfactant administration led to measurable improvement in ET function.
  - Sonotubometry effectively detected the change, supporting its use in **functional ET monitoring** in divers.

## 3. Sonotubometry, a useful tool for the evaluation of the Eustachian tube ventilatory function 

- **Journal**: *Journal of Medicine and Life*
- **Year**: 2014
- **Summary**:  
  Review of the sonotubometry method, covering its clinical utility and physiological basis. Highlights its advantages in **non-invasive ET function assessment**.
- **Equalisation Assessed?** ✅ Yes  
- **Findings**:  
  - Emphasized that sonotubometry can detect **ET opening during swallowing or equalisation maneuvers**.
  - Stated that sonotubometry is particularly useful in **pre-dive screening** to avoid barotrauma.

## Equalisation Assessment Summary

All studies reviewed used **sonotubometry to assess ear equalisation** by measuring sound transmission through the Eustachian tube during maneuvers like swallowing or Valsalva:

- ✅ **Study 1** directly compared sonotubometry results between injured and healthy divers and found clear differences.
- ✅ **Study 2** used sonotubometry to confirm improved ET function from surfactant intervention.
- ✅ **Study 3** discussed how sonotubometry can monitor ET opening in real-time during equalisation attempts.
